## 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence, and specifically Generative AI, is transforming industry sectors worldwide. In Vietnam—one of Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing digital economies—the evolution is particularly pronounced in major urban centers such as Ho Chi Minh City. As companies across sectors such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and retail increasingly adopt AI-driven solutions, the demand for expertise in AI programming, Generative AI tool development, and data science is predicted to surge dramatically.
